description: This package defines the type class @MonadControlIO@, a subset of
             @MonadIO@ into which generic control operations such as @catch@ can
             be lifted from @IO@.  Instances are based on monad transformers in
             @MonadTransControl@, which includes all standard monad transformers
             in the @transformers@ library except @ContT@.  For convenience, it
             provides a wrapped version of @Control.Exception@ with types
             generalized from @IO@ to all monads in @MonadControlIO@.
             .
             Note that this package is a rewrite of Anders Kaseorg's @monad-peel@ library.
             The main difference is that this package provides CPS style
             operators and exploits the @RankNTypes@ language extension to
             simplify most definitions.
             .
             The package includes a copy of the @monad-peel@ testsuite written by Anders Kaseorg.
             The tests can be performed by using @cabal test@.
             .
             The following @critertion@ based benchmark shows that @monad-control@
             is on average about 2.5 times faster than @monad-peel@:
             .
