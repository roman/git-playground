hs-cryptohash provides lots of different secure digest algorithms.

All different cryptohashes contains the exact same API, for ease of
switching between different hashes; this API is separated two folds:
the incremental API and the one-pass API.

= Incremental API

The incremental API permits the user to compute the digest incrementally,
with the overhead of having to box and unbox the context in and out
the computing function.

this API is made of: init, update and finalize; this is similar
to how a digest algorithm works in other languages.

= One Pass API

The one pass API permits a single shot computation that doesn't have
the overhead of boxing and unboxing at each step.

this API is made of: hash and hashlazy. hash works on a strict bytestring,
whereas hashlazy works on a lazy bytestring.
